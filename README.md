# UFOs

## Overview
UFOs are a very interesting topic for many people, especially personal accounts of UFO sightings.  A webpage was created through HTML that lists a multitude of UFO sightings all across the globe.  Since this list is quite extensive, JaveScript was utilized to allow UFO enthusiasts to filter the UFO sightings list by date, city, state, country, and shape.  The usage of JavaScript provides user interactivity on a webpage.


## Results
Input boxes are located next to the search parameter options: date, city, state, country, and shape. These input boxes have a "placeholder" example text to guide users on what information to enter.  When first opening the webpage and not inputting any search criteria, all of the UFO sightings data is listed in the table as shown below.

The user can choose to filter the data by entering only one search option, and then clicking the "enter" button on the keyboard. If the user would like to see UFO sightings with a triangular shape, simply enter "triangle" in the input box next to "Enter a Shape" and then press the "enter" button. The image below shows the filtered list for triangle shaped UFO sightings.

Users can also enter multiple search criteria to further reduce and filter the data. As shown below, city ("san diego") and state ("ca") information were entered to only return sightings that occurred in San Diego, CA.

## Summary
This JavaScript code in combination with HTML provides a great way to filter UFO sightings data in the table.  However, the filter search is case sensitive, so if the input contains uppercase letters, then no data will be returned. This is why the "placeholder" text is shown with all lowercase letters. One way to communicate case sensitivity to users would be to indicate on the website under "Filter Search" to please enter all lowercase letters in their search. Another solution might be to update the code that converts uppercase letters into lowercase letters when users are entering information in the textbox.
