# UFOs

## Overview
UFOs are a very interesting topic for many people, so a webpage was created through HTML that lists a multitude of UFO sightings all across the globe. Since this list is quite extensive, JaveScript was utilized to allow UFO enthusiasts to filter this UFO sightings list by date, city, state, country and shape. The usage of JavaScript provides user interactivity on a webpage.


## Results
Input boxes are located by the search parameter options: date, city, state, country, and shape. These input boxes show a "shadow" example text to guide users what information to enter.  When first opening the webpage and not inputting any search criteria, all of the UFO sightings data is listed in the table as shown below.

The user can choose to filter the data by entering only one search option, and then clicking the "enter" button on the keyboard. If the user would like to see UFO sightings with a triangular shape, simply enter "triangle" in the input box next to "Enter a Shape" and then press the "enter" button. The image below shows the filtered list for triangle shaped UFO sightings.

Users can also enter multiple search criteria to further reduce and filter the data. As shown below, city ("san diego") and state ("ca") information were entered to only return sightings that occurred in San Diego, CA.
